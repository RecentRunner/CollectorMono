This is a small game that I made around 2019. I've long since abandoned it but decided to update the information surrounding it since it's one of the few projects I've been happy with.

# About
A small 2D top-down sandbox game written in C# and using [Monogame](https://www.monogame.net/). there's a WIP inventory system and you can place and destroy blocks in the world.


# Frameworks and libraries used
GUI was rendered using [Myra](https://github.com/rds1983/Myra)

Originally the code was written in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) on Windows in 2019. Currently I'm using visual studio code, Vim and a few other cli programs to edit this together

World generation is created using [Open-Simplex noise](https://gist.github.com/KdotJPG/b1270127455a94ac5d19). Originally I was planning on using my own implementation of [Wang-tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile) to render connected textures

All the textures in the game other than Lucas from the Mother series were made by myself

# Inspiration
The Game was inspired by the [Mystery Dungeon Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Dungeon) and [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/). You can see this in the [design document in the git repo](Collector/Designdoc/Game%20Goals%20(GG).pdf)
